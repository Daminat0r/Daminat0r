Hi, I’m @Daminat0r,
I'm currently studying Computer and Network Engineering and decided it's ✨finally✨ time to make a Github account.
I'm learning lots at the moment, but I like to mess around with hardware and experiment with APIs. 


<!---
Daminat0r/Daminat0r is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
